I'm working as a Research Assistant in [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), Taipei under Prof. [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/). I'm currently working on 2 projects:
* 3D Gaze estimation in the wild. [arXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06924)
* Extreme precipitation prediction. [Problem Statement](/extreme_rainfall/)

I received B.Tech+M.Tech in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/) in 2015, from the IIT Delhi. I worked as a Data Scientist at [Qplum](/qplum/),  an online investment advisory firm, from Dec 2015 to Dec 2018.

I'm actively searching for a PhD position in the area of applying Deep learning techniques on Biomedical data.
