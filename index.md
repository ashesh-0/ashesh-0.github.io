I'm working as a Research Assistant in [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), Taipei under Prof. [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/). I'm currently working on 2 projects:
* 3D Gaze estimation in the wild. [arXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06924)
* Extreme precipitation prediction. [Problem Statement](/extreme_rainfall/), [arXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08175)

I received B.Tech+M.Tech in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/) in 2015, from the IIT Delhi. I worked as a Data Scientist at [Qplum](/qplum/),  an online investment advisory firm, from Dec 2015 to Dec 2018.

I'm actively searching for a PhD position in the area of applying Deep learning techniques on Biomedical data.

## Research Summary
1. Vision: 3D Gaze Estimation: (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06924). Created a novel architecture which is more robust to variations in magnification levels. Developed a novel method for backward gazes. Achieved state of the art results on Gaze360 and RT-GENE dataset.

2. Vision: Extreme Rainfall prediction: Using 3D radar data, 2D rain data, altitude data and few others, aim is to predict the rainfall amount in next 3 hours.  Currently, exploring an image-to-image translation network based approach.

3. ML in Finance (3 years): Used autoencoder to estimate overall market sentiment which was used to create a market neutral strategy. Used regularized linear regression and other techniques for price prediction.

4. ML on Biomedical Data (Thesis):  Subcellular Regulatory Networks Learning (https://ashesh-0.github.io/Masters/). Jointly learnt gene similarity and gene regulatory network using Markov logic networks.  Generated synthetic data and showed the limitations of our work.
